# A slightly different kind of challenge this morning.

# The Company has broken the keyboard on their one and only laptop, so canâ€™t get this bit of code to run. What would the output of this code 
# be (without running it on your own computer)?

# It would output a syntax error due to the underscore instead of a close parenthesis on line 5.
